🎬 Project Overview

This SQL analytics project analyzes RSVP Movies’ past 3 years of movie data to help the production company plan a global movie release (2022). Using SQL, I explored multiple tables to extract insights on movie performance, genres, ratings, contributors (directors/actors), and production trends, and then converted those insights into data-driven recommendations for the upcoming project.

🎯 Problem Statement

RSVP Movies wants to expand from primarily Indian releases to a global audience, and needs to make key production decisions backed by data. The objective is to use SQL-based analysis on historical movie datasets to answer business questions (across multiple segments of analysis) and provide recommendations such as:

- what types of movies perform best (genre, ratings, runtime patterns)

- which contributors (actors/directors) are associated with strong outcomes

- what trends from past releases can guide the strategy for a successful global launch
